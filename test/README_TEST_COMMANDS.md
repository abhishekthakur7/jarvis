# Test Commands Guide

The following npm test commands are now available to validate the layout settings and transparency bug fixes:

## Quick Test Commands

### `npm test`
**Main test command** - Runs the core validation tests
- ✅ Code validation (checks that fixes are applied)
- ✅ Simple transparency bug validation
- ✅ Fast execution (no dependencies required)

### `npm run test:simple`
**Simple transparency test** - Focused test for the transparency bug fix
- Tests default values, custom values, and user scenarios
- Validates that system-design uses 0.85 default (not 0.40)
- Shows clear PASS/FAIL status for each scenario

### `npm run test:validate`
**Code validation** - Checks that the fix is properly implemented
- Verifies LayoutSettingsManager is imported
- Confirms all layouts use centralized defaults
- Ensures no hardcoded transparency values remain

## Comprehensive Test Commands

### `npm run test:all`
**All working tests** - Runs all functional tests including manual validation
- Code validation + Simple test + Manual validation
- Most comprehensive coverage of the transparency fix

### `npm run test:manual`
**Manual validation** - Detailed transparency settings validation
- Tests all transparency scenarios in detail
- Shows CSS property changes
- Displays localStorage state for debugging

## Jest Commands (Advanced)

### `npm run test:jest`
**Jest unit tests** - Runs Jest test suites (if working)
- Requires proper test environment setup
- May need additional configuration for Electron environment

### `npm run test:coverage`
**Coverage report** - Generates test coverage report
- Shows which parts of the code are tested
- Useful for development quality assurance

## Test Results Summary

All core tests should show:
- ✅ **Code Validation**: All fixes properly applied
- ✅ **Default Values**: System design uses 0.85 (not 0.40)
- ✅ **Custom Values**: User settings are preserved
- ✅ **Bug Scenario**: Original reported issue is resolved

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Quick validation of the transparency fix
npm test

# Detailed validation with all test types
npm run test:all

# Just check that code changes were applied correctly
npm run test:validate

# Focus specifically on transparency behavior
npm run test:simple

# See detailed transparency validation
npm run test:manual
```

## What the Tests Validate

1. **System Design Bug Fix**: Transparency now uses 0.85 default instead of 0.40
2. **Settings Persistence**: Custom transparency values survive view changes
3. **Code Implementation**: LayoutSettingsManager is properly used throughout
4. **All Layout Modes**: Normal (0.65), Compact (0.85), System Design (0.85)
5. **User Scenarios**: The exact bug reported by users is resolved

## Expected Output

When all tests pass, you should see:
- ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED!
- ✅ The transparency bug has been successfully fixed!
- ✅ System-design layout now uses 0.85 default (not 0.40)
- ✅ Custom transparency settings are preserved correctly
- ✅ User-reported scenario is resolved

This indicates the transparency settings bug has been completely resolved and is ready for production use.
