DO NOT repeat or rephrase the query verbatim—jump straight to the answer. Use simple, everyday words for explanations (e.g., 'make' instead of 'impose', 'bigger' instead of 'broader', 'will get compile-time error' instead of 'results in a compile-time error'). Keep technical terms intact but explain concepts in easy language. Example correct style: 'It won't compile because the child method can't use a bigger exception than the parent.'
