- **macOS**: DMG package (`.dmg`)
- **Linux**: DEB package (`.deb`) and RPM package (`.rpm`)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### API Key Issues
- **"Invalid API key" error**: Verify your Gemini API key is correct and has proper permissions
- **API key not saving**: Check that localStorage is enabled in your browser/Electron
- **Notion integration not working**: Ensure your Notion integration has access to the pages you're trying to use

#### Audio Issues
- **Microphone not working**: Check system permissions for microphone access
- **Speaker detection not working**: Ensure system audio capture is enabled (Windows requires additional setup)
- **Audio processing lag**: Try adjusting audio quality settings in the Advanced view

#### Performance Issues
- **High CPU usage**: Disable automatic screenshots or increase the capture interval
- **Memory issues**: Clear conversation history periodically or restart the session
- **Window positioning issues**: Use keyboard shortcuts to reposition the window

#### Platform-Specific Issues

**Windows:**
- Speaker audio capture requires Windows 10 version 2004 or later
- Some antivirus software may flag the application - add it to exclusions if needed

**macOS:**
- Grant microphone and screen recording permissions in System Preferences
- Code signing may require additional setup for distribution

**Linux:**
- Ensure PulseAudio or ALSA is properly configured for audio capture
- Some distributions may require additional audio packages

The project provides comprehensive npm scripts for development and deployment:

| Script | Command | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Development** | `npm start` | Launch the application in development mode with hot-reload |
| **Code Quality** | `npm run lint` | Run ESLint for code quality analysis (currently placeholder) |
| **Formatting** | `npm run format` | Auto-format source files with Prettier (when configured) |
| **Packaging** | `npm run package` | Package the application without creating installers |
| **Distribution** | `npm run make` | Build complete distributable packages for all platforms |
| **Publishing** | `npm run publish` | Publish the application to configured distribution channels |

### 🛠️ Debug Mode

For development and troubleshooting, enable debug mode with environment variables:

```bash
# Enable comprehensive audio debugging
DEBUG_AUDIO=true npm start

# Enable development mode with extended logging
NODE_ENV=development npm start

# Enable specific component debugging
DEBUG_GEMINI=true npm start
DEBUG_NOTION=true npm start
```

### 🔐 Centralized Configuration

All keyboard shortcuts are managed through a unified configuration system:

- **Location:** `src/utils/shortcutConfig.js`
- **Benefits:** Single source of truth for all keybinds across views
- **Customization:** Edit once, automatically propagated to all components
- **Platform Awareness:** Automatic platform-specific defaults (Cmd vs Ctrl)

```javascript
// Example: Adding a new shortcut
const newShortcut = {
    customAction: isMac ? 'Cmd+Shift+N' : 'Ctrl+Shift+N'
};
```

## Security & Privacy

### Data Handling
- **API Keys**: Stored locally using localStorage, never transmitted except to their respective services
- **Audio Data**: Processed locally and sent only to Google's Speech-to-Text API when transcription is enabled
- **Screenshots**: Captured locally and sent to Gemini API only when screen analysis is active
- **Conversation History**: Stored locally in IndexedDB, can be cleared at any time
- **Notion Data**: Only accessed when explicitly configured and authorized by the user

### Privacy Features
- **Stealth Mode**: Disguises the application window title and process name for privacy
- **Interview Mode**: Special privacy protections for sensitive environments
- **Content Protection**: Prevents certain data from being logged or saved
- **Local Storage**: All personal data remains on your device

### Permissions Required
- **Microphone Access**: For voice input and transcription
- **Screen Recording**: For screenshot analysis (macOS)
- **System Audio**: For speaker detection and transcription (platform-dependent)

### Security Best Practices
- Keep your API keys secure and don't share them
- Regularly clear conversation history if handling sensitive information
- Use stealth mode in environments where privacy is critical
- Review and configure audio/screen capture settings based on your needs
